Functionality and Correctness:

The variable and method names are generally meaningful and descriptive. Examples include setUpPits(), initializeBoard(), and moveStones(). However, there are some commented-out lines in registerPlayers() that could provide more clarity.
Improvement: Uncomment and use the lines in registerPlayers() for setting owners of stores.
Coding Conventions and Formatting:

The code generally follows Java coding conventions, but there are commented-out lines that can be removed to enhance clarity.
Improvement: Remove unnecessary commented-out lines to maintain a clean codebase.
Encapsulation:

The classes are reasonably encapsulated, with member variables being private and accessed through methods.
Improvement: Consider using accessor and mutator methods for playerOne, playerTwo, and currentPlayer in the Board class.
Code Duplication:

There is no apparent code duplication in the provided code. Methods appear to have distinct purposes.
Responsibility and Code Structure:

Classes and methods have a single, obvious purpose. However, the TextUI class contains a comment about switching players, suggesting that the switching logic might be better placed in the Board class.
Improvement: Move the switching logic to the Board class to maintain better separation of concerns.
In summary, the provided code is generally well-structured and follows coding conventions. The improvements suggested focus on enhancing clarity, removing unnecessary commented-out lines, and refining encapsulation.
